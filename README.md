Recording videos, and playing around with them programmatically, is one of the coolest things you can do with your phone, but not nearly enough apps make use of it. To do this requires the AV Foundation framework that has been a part of macOS since OS X Lion (10.7), and iOS since iOS 4 in 2010.
AV Foundation has grown considerably since then, with well over 100 classes now. This tutorial covers media playback and some light editing to get you started with AV Foundation. 
In particular, youâ€™ll learn how to:
 - Select and play a video from the media library.
 - Record and save a video to the media library.
 - Merge multiple videos together into a combined video, complete with a custom soundtrack!
